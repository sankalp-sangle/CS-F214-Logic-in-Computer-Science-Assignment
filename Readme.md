### Problem Statement (Set 2):
1. To check whether a given binary relation is transitive over a given set.
2. To compute the transitive closure of a binary relation over a given set.<br>
**Note** - The entire question is given in Question.pdf

### Predicates' Description:
**Note:**
 1. A, B are Lists.
 2. S is a list of elements in the Set.
 3. R is the binary relation on the set S.
 4. X is used to compute and return a value.

**appendList(A,B,X):** Appends lists A and B and returns them as X.<br>
**validRelation(S,R):** Checks whether all elements in R belong to S.<br>
**transitiveCheck(R):** Checks whether R is transitive.<br>
**transitive(R,S):** Checks whether R is over S and is transitive.<br>
**closureCheck(R,X):** Computes the transitive closure of the Relation R and returns it as X.<br>
**closure(S,R):** Checks whether R is valid over S and prints transitive closure of R<br>.
